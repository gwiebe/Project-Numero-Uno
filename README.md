I'll be honest, as a kid computers and the internet were never my forte. 
I hadn't had access to a relatively fast PC until I was 14. 
It was an HP laptop that I used for entertainment. 
Youtube, Netflix, Reddit, 4chan, you know, normal middle school internet surfing.
It wouldn't be till my sophmore year when I'd get my get my own personal device, a hand-me down toshiba my sister had used for school.

The moment that Toshiba became mine I abused it to its most minimal potential.
I used it on nearly all school related work, with google docs and wikipidia being my life boats throught english and history.
My senior year of highschool would be the turning point in in my digital presence.
Facebook, Twitter, and Snapchat became alomost neccisary to keep in touch with friends and family.
To this day I still sparcely use these sites to express myself, they act more as a place of one on one conversation.

By far my most used chat based service is TeamSpeak, which me and my friends have used for the past three years to talk with one another.
TeamSpeak is primarily speach based with text and image sharing.
This was my primary source of sociability on a digital level.
Despite the systems archaic design TeamSpeak has proven incredibly reliable over the past few years.
I first came across the service during my junior year when a friend of mine created his own service to do homework with our group of friends.
The service quickly deteriorated into a board for us to communicate in while playing Counter Strike.

The lack of any major updates to the design of certain system leads to a great comparison between different various social networks.
My most frequently visited website is unquestionably Reddit.
I started browsing the website when my eighth grade social studies teacher used images from r/history to provide some sort of entertainment to engage the class.
Despite the website's lack of major, inovating changes it has managed to retain millions of dedicated users. 
It was my first dive into a major social network and has influenced the way I look at all websites and how they manage to not just gain, but maintain a steady stream of users.

Reddit encouraged me to become more inclined to voice an opinion with the knowledge that there are hundreds of people with similar opinions and interesting perspectives.
By the time I recieved my own personal laptop I had become infatuated with the site and an avid browser and commentor.
Boards like r/books, and r/asoiaf were personal favorites as most converstaion was limited yet concise.
The ideal for these more structured discussions became my reasoning for distaste in the more popular networking sites.

Facebook, to me, seems to be the antithesis to reddit.
With constant updates and unpopular decision making, facebook despite having a more "modern" design is more aggrivating than the more old fashion designs I have grown accustomed to.

Of cource this is not a major concensus. 
My oppinion of popular social media is incredibly bias as I attached myself to a more niche form.

I found a comftorble place in these websites, they're where my digital presence began, but no matter the beginning I refuse to shy away from new opportunities, even if my first immpression may be overtly critical.
